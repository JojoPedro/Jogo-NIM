<h1>NIM Game</h1>
<h3>I was doing a course at coursera and then they gave me this exercise. Nim is the most well-known example of an impartial game, where two players (in this case, you and the machine) alternately take turns in taking objects from several heaps. The only rule is that each player must take at least one object on their turn, but they may take more than one object in a single turn </h3>

<h1>RULES</h1>
<h3>In this game you'll define the amount of pieces the game will have and the amount that each player can take in a round. When the amount of pieces reach 0 the game will announce the winner of the round</h3>

<h1>Modes</h1>
<h3>The game have two options: Isolated match and Championship</h3>

<h1>Isolated match</h1>
<h3>In a isolated match you'll have just one chance to win against the machine</h3>

<h1>Championship</h1>
<h3>In a championship match you'll have three chances to win against the machine</h3>
